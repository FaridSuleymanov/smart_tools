MAGI Advisor: AI-driven Decision-making simulated supercomputer Inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion

Overview
The MAGI is a powerful decision-making tool inspired by the MAGI system from the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime television series. It utilizes the OpenAI API to simulate a multi-supercomputer decision-making process, providing diverse insights and perspectives on user-submitted questions.

Features:
Three simulated supercomputers: The app divides the analysis into three distinct simulated supercomputers (Casper, Balthasar, Melchior) each focusing on a specific aspect of decision-making: Casper for logic and rationality, Balthasar for empathy and understanding human emotions, Melchior for intuition and creativity.
Optional Fourth simulated supercomputer: An additional simulated supercomputer can be implemented to combine insights from various fields, such as military strategy, science, engineering, and philosophy, providing a synthesized answer representing the best course of action.
OpenAI API Integration: The MAGI Advisor leverages the power of the OpenAI API to generate tailored responses for each simulated supercomputer, offering users comprehensive and diverse viewpoints on their questions.
How It Works
Users input their questions into the app, following the provided templates.
The app generates responses from each of three different simulated supercomputers using OpenAI API requests.
Users can analyze and synthesize the diverse insights provided by the different simulated supercomputers to make informed decisions based on the collective wisdom of the AI.
Example Usage
Question: "What is the best approach to evacuate a city during a natural disaster?"

Casper (Logic and Rationality) Response: "Develop a well-organized evacuation plan prioritizing the most vulnerable populations and efficiently using available transportation resources."
Balthasar (Empathy and Human Emotions) Response: "Ensure people feel safe and supported during this difficult time through emotional support and clear communication."
Melchior (Intuition and Creativity) Response: "Utilize unconventional methods, such as social media and local communities, to disseminate information quickly and efficiently."
By analyzing and synthesizing these responses, users can gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation and make informed decisions based on the collective wisdom of the different cores.

MAGI Maps: AI-driven Evacuation Routing with OpenRouteService Integration Inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion

Overview
MAGI Maps is a sophisticated evacuation routing app inspired by the MAGI system from the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime television series. It leverages the power of the OpenAI, OpenRouteService APIs, and the MIT AI2 platform to provide users with safe, fast, and efficient evacuation routes during military conflicts, while also generating possible enemy routes and considering their locations and movements.

Features
Three AI-driven simulated supercomputers: The app integrates three distinct AI-driven simulated supercomputers, each representing a specific aspect of decision-making: Casper for logic and rationality, Balthasar for empathy and understanding human emotions, Melchior for intuition and creativity.
OpenRouteService Integration: MAGI Maps uses OpenRouteService to generate accurate evacuation routes for users and possible routes of enemies, taking into account various factors such as road conditions and traffic.
OpenAI API Integration: MAGI Maps uses the OpenAI API to generate tailored responses and recommendations based on the input data and individual simulated supercomputers' perspectives.
Movement Analysis: The app considers enemy locations, user and enemy movements, and transportation methods to provide the most accurate evacuation routes possible.
NASA FIRMS Integration: The next version of MAGI Maps will incorporate data from NASA FIRMS to improve emergency route creation based on fire area information.

How It Works
Users input their current location, desired evacuation point, and known enemy locations and descriptions.
The app calculates evacuation routes using OpenRouteService, while taking into account enemy and user positions and movements.
Each simulated supercomputer analyzes the evacuation routes and provides guidance through text directions, ensuring users reach their destination safely and quickly.

Example Usage
User inputs: current location, evacuation point, and enemy locations with descriptions

MAGI Maps calculates an evacuation route that avoids known enemy positions and movements using OpenRouteService.
Casper (Logic and Rationality) Response: "Take the shortest route while avoiding major roads that could be targeted by the enemy."
Balthasar (Empathy and Human Emotions) Response: "Choose a route that minimizes panic and stress by avoiding crowded areas and keeping a low profile."
Melchior (Intuition and Creativity) Response: "Utilize unconventional paths and shortcuts, such as alleyways and local knowledge, to expedite the evacuation process."
By following the directions and recommendations provided by the different cores, users can safely and efficiently reach their desired evacuation point.
